# AI Fairness Analysis ⚖️🧠

This project explores fairness in machine learning models using Python. It includes an interactive Jupyter notebook and an HTML report that analyze algorithmic bias using fairness metrics, visualizations, and preprocessed datasets.

## 📁 Files

- `AI_Fairness.ipynb` — The main Jupyter notebook with analysis and code.

---

## 🧪 Highlights

- Introduces concepts of algorithmic bias and fairness.
- Applies fairness metrics such as disparate impact and statistical parity.
- Visualizes results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Evaluates model behavior across sensitive groups.
